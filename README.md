# sensibility_testbed
# pedometer

This project focus on indoor path tracking / localization based on sensibility_testbed. By analysis of the accelerometer data, it can determine device's different carry method(trouser pocket, coat porcket or hold in hand) and detecting walking step correctly. Improving the accuracy for different devices by introducing pre-calibration stage and moving average filter. 



Finished work: Pedometer
Future plan: Distance estimation
